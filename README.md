# Project 2 - Flix

Flix is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: 15 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [x] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [x] User can search for a movie.
- [x] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [x] User can view the large movie poster by tapping on a cell.
- [x] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [x] Customize the selection effect of the cell.
- [x] Customize the navigation bar.
- [x] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Home screen that leads to Now Playing and Upcoming Releases pages.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to change it to tab bar controller and still have both pages get all the same data (currently passed with prepareforSegue functions)
2. Making code more efficient (less repeated between the two pages)

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
It was a challenge knowing where I could refer to different things (such as movie features), and keeping track of so many view controllers and how they were connected to each other.
